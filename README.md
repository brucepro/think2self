# Think2Self

## Introduction

*Still in development, but seems to be working. Doesn't play nice with other extensions that use the custom_generate_chat_prompt functions* 
Think2Self adds extra prompts to each user input to allow the A.I. to develop a plan and have a chain of thought about each input.
